# Zero To Mastery Hacktoberfest Projects

This event is a super popular event throughout the Zero To Mastery community, with nearly 900 pull requests made to the [three projects](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-31) available last year. Let's smash that record this year with our massive ZTM family!

**Following their success, we are excited to announce 3 brand new projects for this year's Hacktoberfest:**

#### [![Canvaz](https://img.shields.io/badge/CREATIVE%20CSS%20PROJECT-Canvaz-4E3188?style=for-the-badge&logo=CSS3)](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Canvaz)

Your favourite annual creative challenge for Hacktoberfest is here! We will once again be showcasing the creative talents of our ZTM students, this time using the HTML <canvas> element.

#### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

> Using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, your mission is to create a work of art with the `<canvas>` element. It can be as simple or elaborate as you like, however please ensure that the code is your own, and not copied from other sources.

#### [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Html%20%26%20Javascript%20%26%20CSS%20PROJECT%20Powered%20by%20StencilJS-WebBlocks-00adb5?style=for-the-badge&logo=JavaScript)](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/WebBlocks)

Welcome to this years HTML challenge for Hacktoberfest, a project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing HTML, CSS & maybe a dash of JavaScript to create a component library showcase.

##### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

> There is a big hype about front-end frameworks all over the place. But what if we could build components without the need to reach out for big players like React,Vue and Angular?
>
> Turns out, this is a totally possible thing to do and it is quite easy using StencilJs, not only that we can build components which we can use in vanilla HTML, JS and CSS projects, but also creating components which we can also reuse with frameworks like React, Vue and Angular.
>
> So the goal of this project is to exactly showcase that

#### [![ASCII ART](https://img.shields.io/badge/PYTHON%20PROJECT-ASCII%20ART-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=Python)](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/ascii-art-2021)

Welcome to this years Python challenge for Hacktoberfest, A project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing Python to convert images into ASCII Art.

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters.

##### PROJECT INTRODUCTION

> Let's see how we can evolve the ASCII generator with our ZTM community help!! Maybe we want to display this on an HTML web page where users can submit images and we convert it to ASCII art? Maybe we want to improve how the Command Line Tool works/make it more customizeable? Or maybe modify the script to do many other types of art beyond ASCII.

The options are endless and there is no wrong answer. This is all for fun, so try to customize the tool whichever way you think would be best and let's see what we get at the end of the month! Enjoy!

# But how do I make a pull request/participate?

> If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). This repo has everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR.
> Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

# What happens after I make a pull request?

Simply speaking, your work is done. You can continue working and making pull requests on the same repo or work on something new.

Meanwhile, Hacktoberfest keeps track of all your pull requests. And, as mentioned above, you'll be eligible to get the Hacktoberfest shirt once you successfully make 4 pull requests.

> Some repositories are ineligible for Hacktoberfest as they aren't up to the mark with the event's values. You can find all **Zero To Mastery** repositories that are eligible for the event [here](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahacktoberfest+org%3Azero-to-mastery+fork%3Atrue).

**Remember, you only need to make 4 pull requests to one of these open source projects in the month of October, and you get an awesome Hacktoberfest shirt! Let's see if we can beat the record from last year!!**
